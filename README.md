# page-changer and content show on scroll


Page change looks like ajax call but it's click -> animation -> page change -> animate entrace

Elements with class ``hideMe`` are hidden until scroll position animates to enter.

options for time delay, position and animation duration:

```html
<div class="hideMe" data-hidemedelay="300" data-hidemetime="100"></div>
```
